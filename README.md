## Getting started

1. Install `mcrypt`.
2. Run `./gen_puzzle.py` to generate `puzzle.zip`.
3. Set up a virtual machine with a simple (no desktop environment, limited pre-installed packages) linux distribution, for instance [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server).
4. Transfer `puzzle.zip` to the home directory of the virtual machine.

## Playing

2 (or more) people play together in a team to solve the puzzle. One person
controls the keyboard and cannot see the screen. The rest of the team can
see the screen but cannot control the keyboard.

The puzzle is designed to be a time-attack between two or more teams.
Checkpoints serve as intermediate goalposts that can yield points to the first
team to pass them or disadvantages for opposing teams.
